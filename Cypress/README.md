# Scenarios

Information about tests and some choosen solution added in info-test-cases file.

# Note

Not everywhere data-test selector was used just to learn and test a little bit more...

# TODO

- Added negative and edge case tests (empty fields, unexpected input (some kind of fuzz testing?)).
- API response mocking (cy.intercept()), server errors.
- Integrate some kind of test reporting tool (generate and store).
